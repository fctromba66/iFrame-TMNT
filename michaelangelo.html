       <h1 class="M">Michaelangelo</h1>
        <p>Michelangelo is a naturally skilled athlete, which often makes up for his lack of eagerness to participate in long training sessions. He is a practical joker and class-clown who keeps his brothers both annoyed and entertained at times. Splinter chose the nunchaku as Mikey's weapon since it best suited his show-stopping style and spirit. His favorite color is orange and he loves pizza the most out of any of the Turtles.</p>
