       <h1 class="R">Raphel</h1>
        <p>Raphael is by far the most fearsome and fearless fighter of the group, although he has trouble mastering his emotions at times. He is often steadfast and strong-minded and he acts like a typical rebel who questions authority. Raph understands he needs to work on keeping his temper in control but, simply put, he prefers to be left alone at times. Raph's favorite color is red. Splinter chose twin sais for his weapon due to his quick and "pointed" personality.</p>
