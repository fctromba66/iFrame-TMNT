       <h1 class="D">Donatello</h1>
        <p>Donatello is the brainiest turtle of the bunch and has the unique ability to figure out how things work. His brothers are fortunate to have him around because he has invented many of their bodacious transportation vehicles, including the Battle Shell, Shell Cycle and the Sewer Slider. Donnie would rather solve a problem by talking it out rather than fighting, but this is rarely an option in a world in which the Foot Clan lurks. This makes the bo staff the perfect weapon for Donatello since he is long on inspiration and stout of heart. His favorite color is purple.</p>
