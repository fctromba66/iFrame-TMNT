       <h1 class="L">Leonardo</h1>
        <p>Leonardo is considered the "big brother" of the group due to his serious and responsible nature. He has taken on the unofficial title of "leader" of the Turtles and leads by example and not by giving orders, thus earning Leo great respect from his brothers. Leo is everything you'd want in a hero because no one works, studies, or trains harder than he does. Leo's favorite color is blue and his weapons are twin katana swords, bestowed upon him by Splinter due to the turtle's sharp mind and steely resolve.</p>
